\begin{abstract}

It is increasingly common for enterprises and other organizations to outsource network processing -- such as firewalling and caching -- to the cloud, just as they often outsource compute and storage.
However, this poses a threat to enterprise confidentiality because the cloud provider gains access to the organization's traffic.

We design and build \sys, the first system that enables a cloud provider to offer a wide range of middleboxes while maintaining client confidentiality. \sys encrypts the traffic that reaches the cloud and enables the cloud to process the  encrypted traffic {\em without decrypting it}.
\sys supports a wide-range of middleboxes such as firewalls, NATs, web proxies, load balancers, intrusion prevention systems, and data exfiltration systems. Our evaluation shows that \sys supports these applications with competitive performance: per-middlebox throughput is affected by only 1\%.

\todo{general comment for both abstract and intro: I am not sure we are for compute and storage! we are for the reasons
in aplomb, maintenance, upgrade, etc.}
