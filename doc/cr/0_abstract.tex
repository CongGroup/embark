{\it %%Sylvia and scott style is to put the abstract in italics.
It is increasingly common for enterprises and other organizations to outsource network processing to the cloud. 
For example, enterprises may outsource firewalling, caching, and deep packet inspection, just as they outsource compute and storage.
However, this poses a threat to enterprise confidentiality because the cloud provider gains access to the organization's traffic.

We design and build \sys, the first system that enables a cloud provider to support middlebox outsourcing while maintaining the client's confidentiality. \sys encrypts the traffic that reaches the cloud and enables the cloud to process the  encrypted traffic {without decrypting it}.
\sys supports a wide-range of middleboxes such as firewalls, NATs, web proxies, load balancers,  and data exfiltration systems. Our evaluation shows that \sys supports these applications with competitive performance. %: per-middlebox throughput is affected by at worst 2.7\%.
