Network middleboxes such as firewalls, proxies, and intrusion prevention systems are crucial components of modern networks. Recently, more and more organizations are outsourcing their middleboxes to the cloud. However, this poses a problem for the confidentiality of the traffic because now the cloud provider has access to the organization's traffic.


We design and build \sys (read ``embark''), the first system that enables running a wide range of middleboxes at a cloud provider while maintaining the confidentiality of the traffic. \sys encrypts the traffic that reaches the cloud and enables the cloud to process the encrypted traffic without decrypting it.
\sys supports a wide-range of middleboxes such as firewall, NAT, web proxy, load balancing, IP forwarding, intrusion prevention systems, data exfiltration systems, and VPN. Our evaluation shows that \sys supports these applications with competitive performance.
