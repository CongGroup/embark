\section{Other middleboxes}\label{sec:vpn} \label{sec:other_apps} \label{sec:not_supp}\label{sec:loadb}
\qu{should we call them applications or middleboxes in the sections above?}


L4 load balancer
L7 load balancer

-- VPN naturally remains the same. 

-- make the tables of applications consistent with each other and make sure we support all 

-- what is difference between L4 and L7 load balancer -- do we need both?

-- IP forwarding app, what is that?

-- how about the application firewall?

-- discuss wan optimizers and compression, that aplomb does not really support them in the basic model (requiring this special model that is not quite aplomb) -- also the conflicts it would show up for us
