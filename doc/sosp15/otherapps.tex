\section{Other middleboxes and limitations}\label{sec:vpn} \label{sec:other_apps} \label{sec:not_supp}\label{sec:loadb}

In this section, we discuss other middleboxes we support, which are straightforward extensions of the ones presented so far. 

\bpara{Load balancer} \todo{write me, anything about L4 and L7?}

\bpara{VPN} The VPN remains the same. It does not perform any computation on encrypted traffic. 

\bpara{IP forwarding} This middlebox is implemented similarly to a NAT and firewall. 

\bpara{Application firewall} This middlebox is a simple version of an IDS combined with a firewall. 


\todo{-- make the tables of applications consistent with each other and make sure we support all }

\bpara{WAN optimizers} A lot of WAN optimizers do compression. \todo{how does this fit into aplomb?}
-- discuss wan optimizers and compression, that aplomb does not really support them in the basic model (requiring this special model that is not quite aplomb) -- also the conflicts it would show up for us
This middlebox is at odds with the IDS because if the data gets compressed, the IDS detection does not work any more; if the data gets encrypted for the IDS, compression is not longer possible.
