\section{Building blocks}\label{sec:blocks}


An important operation over an encrypted packet is to determine if an encrypted field in the packet falls in an encrypted range.
We will use the firewall as an example. 
Consider the following firewall rule:




\subsection{Range match encoding scheme}


Constructing an encryption scheme that allows checking if an encrypted value is in an encrypted range, has been a challenge in the applied cryptography community. The reason is that ..
So none of the existing schemes are satisfactory.



sOPE applies to cases when we know an upper bound on the values encrypted with OPE and this is a small number of values (say, less than 10,000).

The small number of values permits us to improve in two ways over mOPE [1]
No more interaction. We store the tree in mOPE on the gateway (client) side, which means that the gateway can compute a new encryption by itself without help from service provider. The storage at the gateway will remain small.
Rare updates to ciphertexts. We can space out the ciphertexts of the values encrypted sufficiently. 

This also enjoys a stronger security than OPE! It leaks less than order.
The reason is that, the server does not learn the order between the values in packets, and only whether they map between two values in the rules. 





this one is new

discuss 

would be good to explain the challenge from the 

\todo{a more interesting name to the scheme}

\subsection{Network processing for range}

prefix gets mapped into interval, at most a certain number

talk about building certain data structures that all works the same

firewall need not change 

\subsection{Keyword match}
