\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:concl}



In this paper, we presented \sys, the first system that enables running a wide range of middleboxes at a service provider 
while maintaining the confidentiality of traffic. \sys works by enabling the service provider to compute on the encrypted traffic without decrypting it. 
We showed that \sys supports a wide-range of middleboxes (such as firewall, NAT, web proxy, load balancing, IP forwarding, intrusion prevention systems, data exfiltration systems, and VPN), and provides competitive performance.
