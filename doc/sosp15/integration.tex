need to integrate somewhere firewall and nat and explain

Putting them together

new packet structure, before and after

describe conflicts between applications -- some were already resolved above 

integrate with ssl, strong encryption

\section{Discussion}

No one will put a firewall behind a NAT

since we are giving primitives, one might be able to add later applications that can also be supported with the same primitives, although one has to add encryption at the gateway for the specific fields 

What do we do about these issues?

Checksum Many middleboxes change packet contents, and thus packet check-
sums. However, it is not clear that if we can compute correct checksums based

on encrypted packet contents.

IP Fragmentation Middleboxes working above L3 may need to reassemble

IP fragments, our encryption scheme need to be carefully designed to avoid any

issues.
