\section{System implementation} \label{sec:impl}

\todo{this is important to write properly because it is a systems paper and there were some nontrivial decisions}.

Things to cover:

- gateway and middlebox implementation

- explain why the firewall hardware does not change (or was that above?)

- second flow udp/tcp

- new packet structure and headers -- multiple layers of headers? graph? (there is some text and a figure in a google doc about this)

- some things are specific to web proxy from what I remember
